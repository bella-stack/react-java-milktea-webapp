### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Maven**: Follow the official [Maven installation guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

#### VSCode Extensions:
- **Spring Boot Extension Pack**: Provides support for running and debugging Spring Boot applications.
- **Java Extension Pack**: Offers Java language support, debugging capabilities, and more.
- **Maven for Java**: Assists in handling Maven projects within VSCode.

2. **Set up `pom.xml`**: Ensure that your project's `pom.xml` is configured with the necessary dependencies.

3. **Configure Database in `resources/application.yml`**:
    - Update the file with your specific database credentials, or it would conflict with your local pg-database.
    - **Important**: Add `application.yml` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent overwriting other team members' credentials.
    - Ensure that you've pulled the latest .gitignore file. Please refrain from pushing compiled WAR files or other output files to the repository

1. Make sure your database proxy is on.
2. Navigate to the root of `pos-webapp`.
3. Execute command: 1. for rebuilding: `mvn clean install` 2. for running: `mvn spring-boot:run`.
